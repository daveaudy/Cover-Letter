# Cover-Letter
I have been employed with Vadim Software for 28 years, however, my current position will be discontinued as of March 31, 2017 as a result of Aptean Software purchasing our parent company StarDyne and its sister companies. 

I have had several roles in my years at Vadim in all areas of Production development life cycle including specification gathering, design, development, Implementation and Support which also may prove to be an asset to your company.

Product Analyst:
One of my many roles I have had, has been as a Product Analyst. I was responsible for reviewing existing applications, along with new specification requirements and software shortfalls.  I would work alongside management, customers and support department during this role.
I was responsible for the application design and specifications and creating Use cases for the development team.  I would then work with developers ensuring they understood the requirements at the beginning of development and any questions that would come up during the development stage.

Data Modeling:
The Vadim suite of applications needed to be ported to Windows/SQL prior to 2000 because of Y2K.
I was responsible for designing conceptual and physical data models for each of the applications using an application called Power Designer.  These data models were used to generate SQL code which would create the tables, primary keys and indexes.
Part of this data modeling included creating Data flow diagrams and Business Flow diagrams.

Software Integration:
I have completed several projects involving integrating Vadimâ€™s iCity applications to other 3rd party applications including GIS, Human Resources and other applications.

Data Conversion
I have designed, developed, implemented and supported data conversion tools to convert customer data to our suite of products and worked with customer to ensure completeness and accuracy.

Relational Database experience
Since 1998 I have been using MS SQL. I am familiar with creating stored procedures/triggers and database security/administration. 
Software development:
Most of my development work has been in a client/server environment, not in a browser based software environment. 
Within this past year we have been rolling out a new version of our software which has been ported to WinForms and C# in Visual Studio.  

Customer/Employee Training
I have trained customers and employees on software usage, both onsite and using remote applications like Team Viewer, GoToAssist, WebEx and others.

Customer Support
I have worked with and for the support department at a tier one level.  This meant either solving the issue on the phone with the customer or if it was a quick resolution, solved myself.

Change Management Software
We have used change management applications Microsoft Visual SourceSafe and Perforce

Software environment:
I am familiar with working in both a Waterfall and Agile environments.

References:
I can provide references upon your request.
